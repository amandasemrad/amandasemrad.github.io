        <p>
          My name is Amanda, I am currently working as a freelance designer/photographer on a variety of diverse projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always had an aspiration for creating things. I grew up admiring the beauty of older(vintage) objects and fashion styles. Which drew me to Fashion Design. After graduating from FIDM. I started working in the fashion design industry which has allowed me to master the noble skill set of being able to construct a garment from the beginning of the basic pattern to end of the stunningly constructed garment. I feel comfortable in saying I now know the ins-and-outs of how the apparel world runs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whereas, getting a degree in graphic design has opened my mind to a whole other world of design. I still use my hands, but my mind gets to explore creativity in so many different directions. It seems forever pleasing.
          I have five years in the fashion industry and two years of Freelance Design under my belt. I love the fast-paced world of design and enjoy working in a team environment I am also successful at being creative, productive and have the ability to stay on task working on my own. My years in the industry has strengthened my ability to be versatile in many different creative ways.
        </p>

        <p>
          My passion for fashion, design and photography comes from this grand idea of never-ending knowledge and beauty. I aim to always have something more to learn and to share with others. I would love to also collaborate with others so feel free to contact me. For you personally or for a collaboration.
